Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Rentaro", "Futagami", ,"futagamirentaro@gmail.com",c("aut","cre"))
Description: The ellipsis is used in for example the plot function frequently
    to provide flexible visualization.
    When we implement the plot function as the S3 generic method or others,
    we want to set the default graphics parameters such as `xlab` and `title`
    to the ellipsis in some cases.
    Then, to implement proces for setting the default or for rejecting or accepting
    the user's specific value instead of the default is takes time and effort.
    This package makes the process easily.
