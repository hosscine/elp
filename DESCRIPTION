Description: Ellipsis is used in for example the plot function frequently
    to provide flexible visualization.
    When we implement the plot function as the S3 generic method,
    we want to set the default value such as `xlab` or `title`
    to the ellipsis in some cases.
    Then, to implement proces for rejecting or accepting
    the user's specific value instead of default is takes time and effort.
    This package makes the process easily.
